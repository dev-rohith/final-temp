# Getting Started

- System requirements
  - Node.JS v18
- Set environment variables: create a `.env` file in the root directory, and copy the contents from [.env.sample](.env.sample)
- Install dependencies
  ```
  yarn
  kjhvjh
  ```
- Seed database
  ```
  yarn seed
  ```sdjkfgjsdb,sdnfjs 
- Start the dev server
  ```
  yarn dev
  ```

# Getting Started (Docker)

Instead of following the steps above, you can also use Docker to set up your environment.

- System requirements
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Run `docker-compose up` to spin up the dev server.
- Enter `Ctrl-C` in the same same terminal or `docker-compose down` in a separate terminal to shut down the server.

# Verify That Everything Is Set Up Correctly

You can use cURL or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API.

#### Example Curl Commands

You can log in as one of the seeded users with the following curl command:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/api/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username": "thomas",
    "password": "123456"
}'
```

Then you can use the token that comes back from the /login request to make an authenticated request to create a new blog post

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/api/posts' \
--header 'x-access-token: your-token-here' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "text": "This is some text for the blog post...",
    "tags": ["travel", "hotel"]
}'
```

# Helpful Commands

- `yarn lint` : Runs linter.
- `yarn prettier --write .` : Runs autoformatter
- `yarn test` : This repository contains a non-comprehensive set of unit tests used to determine if your code meets the basic requirements of the assignment. **Please do not modify these tests.**
- `yarn seed` : Resets database and populates it with sample data.

# Common Setup Errors

- If you encounter an error related to `secretOrPrivateKey` when attempting to make a request, please ensure you have created a .env file in the root directory as per the _Getting Started_ instructions.
- If you are on M1 mac, you might encounter `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` when you try to install dependencies locally then run the server in docker (or vice versa). In case of error, try removing the `node_modules` directory and restart `docker compose up`.
